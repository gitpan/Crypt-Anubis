Crypt::Anubis
=============

Anubis is a variable-length key, 128-bit block cipher designed by
Vincent Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto. Anubis was submitted as
a NESSIE candidate.

The default key length in this implementation is 128 bits.

BONUS

The C file, _anubis.c, is a standalone Anubis implementation. To
compile it, type:

        gcc -Wall _anubis.c

A new binary, a.out, will be created.

To run the binary, type:

        ./a.out
